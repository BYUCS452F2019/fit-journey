I know this is a tad late. But I would be down to work on this project. I would actually use something like this, I dont like how spread all the different
apps are right now, and my wife would also enjoy using it too so bonus points

I have some web expiereince and front end. But am relatively new to most of this stuff. Most experience has come from CS240 and CS340
